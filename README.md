# RL
This project was created by a high school student based in Korea, and it is not very reliable. It is a project to find out the optimal exploration and utilization ratio through reinforcement learning. Various polynomial functions were used to change the exploration and utilization ratio. What is also interesting is that we looked at the actual ant exploration and utilization ratio and compared the results when we turned the simulation. In addition, the SPSS scatterplot was used in the analysis.

+The program of the project was made using unity3D and C#. However, I lost the code file, so it is not currently up. If I find it soon, I will upload it.
